# EmailJS Security Considerations

When implementing EmailJS in your portfolio project, it's important to understand the security implications and best practices. This document outlines key security considerations for your EmailJS implementation.

## Public Key Security

EmailJS uses a public key system for authentication:

- The **Public Key** included in your client-side code is safe to expose
- This key alone does not provide access to modify your EmailJS templates or services
- However, it does allow sending emails through your account, potentially using your email quota

## Domain Restrictions (Recommended)

To prevent unauthorized use of your EmailJS account:

1. Go to your EmailJS Dashboard > Account > API Keys
2. Add domain restrictions to your public key
3. Specify only domains where your application will be hosted (e.g., `yourportfolio.com`)
4. This prevents other websites from using your EmailJS public key

## Template Variables and Data Safety

- EmailJS templates use predefined variables (e.g., `{{user_email}}`, `{{message}}`)
- These variables should correspond to your form field names
- No sensitive template data is exposed to end-users

## Rate Limiting

EmailJS has built-in rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- Free tier: Limited to 200 emails per month
- Consider implementing your own rate limiting (e.g., prevent multiple submissions)
- Monitor your usage in the EmailJS dashboard

## Form Validation Best Practices

Implement thorough client-side validation:

- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for public forms to prevent spam
- Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Alternative Approaches

If you need more security or control:

- Consider a server-side approach instead of client-side EmailJS
- Use a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions) as a proxy
- Implement your own email sending logic with a backend service

## Privacy Considerations

- Clearly communicate to users how their data will be used
- Consider adding a privacy policy link near your contact form
- Don't store user data unnecessarily after sending emails

## Logging and Debugging

- In production, minimize logging of sensitive form data
- Remove any debug console.log statements that expose email addresses or messages
- Consider implementing error tracking without logging personal data
